This repository contains projects I have completed that utilized various clustering algorithms. The projects within showcase my ability to utilize the following clustomer algorithms and their respective silhouette scores:

1. K-Means
2. K-Medoids
3. Hierarchical Clustering
4. Density Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN)
5. Guassian Mixture Model (GMM)

These projects also showcase my ability to perform data pre-preprocessing and EDA on the associated data sets. 

The first project you will see is the capstone project from MIT's Data Science and Machine Learning program.
