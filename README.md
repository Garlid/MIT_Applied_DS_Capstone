This repository contains projects I have completed that utilized various unsupervised ML clustering algorithms. The projects within showcase my ability to utilize the following clustomer algorithms and their respective silhouette scores:

1. K-Means
2. K-Medoids
3. Hierarchical Clustering
4. Density Based Spatial Clustering (DBSCAN)
5. Guassian Mixture Model (GMM)

These projects also highlight my ability to perform data pre-preprocessing and EDA on large data sets. 

The first project you will see is the capstone project from MIT's Data Science and Machine Learning program. After analyzing various clustering algorithms, I selected K-Medoids as the clustering algorithm that was both least sensitive to outliers and produced the most compact segments in my data, all while having the highest silhouette score. Details of the project, including raw data, code, and the final presentation can be found within the [Market_Segmentation_With_K-Medoids](https://github.com/Garlid/Unsupervised-Machine-Learning/tree/main/Market_Segmentation_With_K-Medoids) folder.
