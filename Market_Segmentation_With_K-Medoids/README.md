This folder contains the final submission for my capstone project for[ MIT's Applied Data Science Program: Leveraging AI for Effective Decision-Making ](https://professional-education-gl.mit.edu/mit-online-data-science-program). This project demonstrates my ability to:

1. Prepare Data
2. Transform Data
3. Engineer Data (feature engineering)
4. Vizualize Data
5. Perform Statistical Analysis
6. Select Appropriate Machine Learning Models For the Data
7. Train The Selected Model(s)
8. Test The Models
9. Analyze Model Errors
10. Communicate/Present Findings To Stakeholders

The following files are contained within this folder:

1. Google Collab Notebook as a .ipynb file, a .py file, and as a PDF in case of difficulty viewing the .ipynb file
2. Raw data
3. Written summary of findings
4. Presentation that was delievered to a live audience on December 13, 2023  

After analyzing the data and looking at the silhouette scores of various clustering algorithms, I decided to recommend using the K-Medoids algorithm. It had the highest silhouette score out of the 5 clustering algorithms I tested. Additionally, the data did have a few outliers, so using this algorithm decreased the sensitivity to these outliers. Below is K-Medoids Cluster Output.
